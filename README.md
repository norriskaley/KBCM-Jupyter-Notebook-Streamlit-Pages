# Project 1 = Bond-Signal-Analysis 
# After learning programming in a week, I was then given my first project. An Excel spreadsheet with 12,500 rows that had information on RFQs. My job was to use Python and my math skills to find out which signal (1, 2 or 3) predicted the price movement best. Also, find out if any of the characteristics of the bond helped predict the movement (quantity, liquidity, maturity, industry sector etc)
