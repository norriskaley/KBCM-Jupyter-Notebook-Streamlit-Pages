# KBCM JUPYTER NOTEBOOK & STREAMLIT PAGES

Project 1 = Bond-Signal-Analysis:
After learning programming in a week, I was then given my first project. An Excel spreadsheet with 12,500 rows that had information on RFQs. My job was to use Python and my math skills to find out which signal (1, 2 or 3) predicted the price movement best. Also, find out if any of the characteristics of the bond helped predict the movement (quantity, liquidity, maturity, industry sector etc)
Files for this project:
1) Project1.ipynb (first notebook, playing around with code)
2) Project1-Regression.ipynb (messing with decision trees and regression types)
3) PROJECT1-ORGANIZED.ipynb (final product that was presented--Signal 3 was found to be best signal)

Project 2 = Create a Streamlit Page to display results found in first project in a user-friendly app like program
I had two runs for this. The first being specific to my Excel file but then I redid it to be able to input your own file and still have data anlysis tailored to your data.
Files for first run:
1) dashboard.py
2) home.py
3) signals.py
4) signals_with_indicators.py
5) properties.py

Files for second run/final project:
1) dashboard.py
2) home_universal.py
3) signals_universal.py
4) signals_with_indicators_universal.py
5) properties_universal.py

Project 3 = Create Streamlit Page to help teammate
Looking at weighted_return by industry sector over time. 
Files for this project:
1) dashboard_sector_analysis.py 
2) home_sector_analysis.py
3) sector_analysis
